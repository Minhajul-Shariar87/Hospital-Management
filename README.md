## 📘 Introduction
We did a project on hospital management system. This database will manage all the salary of the treatment, patient all types of information regarding medical history. 

The Hospital Management System is a centralized database solution designed to streamline healthcare operations by managing patient care, appointments, treatments, insurance, billing, and physician workflows. It tracks patients with personal details (name, address , date of birth , dynamically calculated age, multiple phone numbers) and their linked insurance policies , which include provider data and contact information. Patients schedule appointments  with doctors , recorded with date and time, while medical histories  log conditions, treatments, and associated physicians. Doctors  maintain profiles with personal and employment details, and treatments track procedures, costs, and involved staff. The system automates billing , recording transaction methods and dates, and ensures data integrity through normalization (e.g., deriving age from DOB, decomposed addresses). By minimizing redundancy and enhancing scalability, this project empowers hospitals to improve operational efficiency, patient outcomes, and service transparency.
